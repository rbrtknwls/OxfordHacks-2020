# Safeways (Smart Public Transit Routing)
### Winner at Oxford Hacks 2020

Our project's purpose is to improve public transit safety by giving accurate breakdowns of how much contact you will need to have, in order to get from point a to point b (or c,d,..). It was built with Node.js and has a pure javascript backend, the processing was done using a combination of HERE's APIs (mainly their Mapping, Routing and Public Transit APIs). Much more went into it however, so please try it out for yourself!

## Want to try it out?:   
Enter Destinations as full locations. Or enter your own (keep in mind an invalid address will not show up on the map!)
