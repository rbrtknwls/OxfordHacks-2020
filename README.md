### "HERETECHNOLOGIES: Challenge"

Our project's purpose is to improve public transit safety by giving accurate breakdowns of how much contact you will need to have, in order to get from point a to point b (or c,d,..). It was built with Node.js and has a pure javascript backend, the processing was done using a combination of HERE's APIs (mainly their Mapping, Routing and Public Transit APIs). Much more went into it however, so please try it out for yourself!

## Want to try it out?:   
Enter Destinations as full locations. Or enter your own (keep in mind an invalid address will not show up on the map!)
